# SoftLivingMatter

We seek to understand the assembly, properties and (dys)function of intracellular states of matter, and how they impact the flow of genetic information.

We aim to foster continual innovation - new tools, concepts, & techniques - to understand and manipulate not only intracellular phase transitions, but also to elucidate and harness aspects of biological organization yet to be imagined.

We aim to pursue these frontiers of knowledge within a fun, energetic, and dynamic lab, with mutual respect for one anotherâ€™s diverse backgrounds and viewpoints.
